        <h1>The spread of information and its effects on life since the Industrial Revolution</h1>
        <h4> - Tristan Miranda</h4>

        <div class="container border border-primary rounded border-4">
            <h2>Introductions</h2>
            <p>Within our world, the spread of information has been drastically increased. 
                Today you can search almost anything and find an answer, it wasn't so easy in the past.
                The roots of this informational density can be traced back to the Industrial Revolution.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The world has been changed much faster than before, with computers, then calculators, then mobile
                phones, then smartphones, and many more things. All of these are life changing but the speed at which
                they are invented has been speeding up. The reason for this is simple, the accessbility of information
                which has been on the rise since the Industrial Revolution, has been increasing the ability of inventors
                and scientists. This has led to an improvement in life overall for educated areas.

            <h2>Connections</h2>
            <p>
                Within worlddata.info and nces.ed.gov, you can draw a direct correlation with few outliers that,
                on average, countries with higher education rates especially among later years (15-19) have higher
                life expectancies. The data shows that with increased education comes increased life expectancy.
            </p>
            
            <br>
            <p>
                We can also think logically about the situation as well. The countries with smarter, better educated
                people are also going to have better workers, scientists, architects, and doctors. These countries
                are going to have improved lives as more of them have the potential to be well functioning members
                of society in their country of origin.

            <h2>Relations to the Industrial Revolution</h2>
            <p>
                Now you might wonder, how exactly is this related to the Industrial Revolution, well there is an explanation.
                The Industrial Revolution was a revolution throughout the world of machines and factories. This directly
                lead to the employement of factory workers, factory workers that needed educations to learn how to operate
                machinery. Throughout the years, the machines have become more complicated and specialized, which led
                to more specialized and enhanced education. The Industrial Revolution also promoted child labour, which was
                bad. This, however, led to mandatory child education, which was an ultimately good thing. You can see that literacy
                has been on the rise since the Industrial Revolution as a side effect of needing more child labourers and needing
                those child labourers to be educated enough to read and write.

            <h2>Real World Examples</h2>
            <p>
                Now you might wonder how good education can possibly be today, as the internet is like a glorified
                book. Well you might not consider the accessbility of the internet. Today, almost anyone can access
                the internet and anyone who can read and type can learn from the internet. You also aren't just
                limited to reading. There are videos, examples, games, demonstrations, chatrooms, discussions,
                and many many more resources for learning and exploring a topic. All of these accessible to anyone, and
                many more that are better for tiny prices compared to a college education.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                There is also a rise in Patents since the Industrial Revolution and subsequent education and internet usage.
                The countries where internet is prominent enough to affect inventors and learners can be seen having more
                patents than others. You can also see a general rise in the amount of patents as more and more people get
                exposed to education and inventing as the internet expands to be a truly global device used by all countries
                and every type of person.
            </p><br>
            
            <p>
                There are many examples of what the internet can teach in such an easy way but I want a physical
                demonstration. If you are in person you should see a small device with a wifi symbol on it, I
                made that in under a week with just the internet and parts I ordered online for less than $70.
                The function is simple, Scan a card for a source, then scan any card to check against that first card.
                If it is the same, it flashes green. If it is not the same, it flashes red. If you were to copy a
                card then you would be able to scan both of those cards and gain access. This machine can be expanded easily
                to allow RFID keycard doors and detection of short range objects that match a specific ID. This was all built
                by a 15 year old in under a week with education and materials from the internet, and someone much younger
                could have built this with enough determination.
