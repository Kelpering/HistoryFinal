        <h1>The spread of information and its effects on life since the Industrial Revolution</h1>
        <h3> - Tristan Miranda</h3>

        <div class="container border border-primary">
            <h2>Introductions</h2>
            <p>Within our world, the spread of information has been drastically increased. 
                Today you can search almost anything and find an answer, it wasn't so easy in the past.
                The roots of this informational density can be traced back to the Industrial Revolution.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The world has been changed much faster than before, with computers, then calculators, then mobile
                phones, then smartphones, and many more things. All of these are life changing but the speed at which
                they are invented has been speeding up. The reason for this is simple, the accessbility of information
                which has been on the rise since the Industrial Revolution, has been increasing the ability of inventors
                and scientists. This has led to an improvement in life overall for educated areas.

            <h2>Connections</h2>
            <p>
                Within worlddata.info and nces.ed.gov, you can draw a direct correlation with few outliers that,
                on average, countries with higher education rates especially among later years (15-19) have higher
                life expectancies. The data shows that with increased education comes increased life expectancy.

            </p>
            
            <br>
            <p>
                We can also think logically about the situation as well. The countries with smarter, better educated
                people are also going to have better workers, scientists, architects, and doctors. These countries
                are going to have improved lives as more of them have the potential to be well functioning members
                of society in their country of origin.

            <h2>Relations to the Industrial Revolution</h2>
            <p>
                Now you might wonder, how exactly is this related to the Industrial Revolution, well there is an explanation.
                The Industrial Revolution was a revolution throughout the world of machines and factories. This directly
                lead to the employement of factory workers, factory workers that needed educations to learn how to operate
                machinery. Throughout the years, the machines have become more complicated and specialized, which led
                to more specialized and enhanced education. We had books to educate at the start and now we have the internet.
